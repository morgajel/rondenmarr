Things just got a whole lot more real. I received the first batch of portraits from [Steven De Waele](https://stonedrunkwizard.tumblr.com/) today and wanted to share how awesome they look.

First up is Modif the Cobalt, Priest of Sanith:

When I mentioned yesterday that Steven was working on the sketches, I didn't think I'd be posting the final products today. I am beside myself with how well they turned out.
