I've finished the first round of edits on the second draft- 147 pages printed, corrected, and inserted back into scrivener. Now comes the difficult part- data normalization.

For Example: Each NPC has 3 or more associates that can be found elsewhere in the book- for some (like a certain gnollish spy), this is easy- others are much more difficult. Now I have to circle back and update 40 or so NPCs which are lacking associates. Furthermore, some relationships may be one-directional (A king may not know every subject), while others are bidirectional (Flip and Flop Thragg are siblings). Each of those bidirectional relationships need to be labeled for each NPC.

Beyond this I have some style-guide changes that still need to be formalized and implemented. Plenty of work left to go, but I'm feeling pretty positive at this point.
