While out of town on a work trip, I spent my down time working on the Biographer's Guide.

<!--more-->

As of right now I've reviewed the first draft and marked a ton of changes to be made for the second draft. I'm currently 40 pages in (of 147) to creating the second draft (This is double-spaced).

With any luck I should be able to get this finished up in a day or two.

Meanwhile, [Steven](https://stonedrunkwizard.tumblr.com/) has been hard at work on the first 5 sketches for the artwork. We've been emailing back and forth on art direction so that we both have a solid feel for what the end product will be. More on those tomorrow.
