I'm going to be otherwise occupied for the next few days but wanted to give a status update. [Steven](https://stonedrunkwizard.tumblr.com/) provided a quick video for the indiegogo campaign- I was able to insert it into the kdenlive project without much hassle (as well as his artwork) and it looks pretty decent. Next week I'd like to re-record my section of the video to be a little better quality.

I was able to get the indiegogo campaign updated with the artwork- it's pretty close to ready. Once I get the video finalized and uploaded, I'll be ready to launch this thing.
