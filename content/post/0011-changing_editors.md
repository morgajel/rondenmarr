For the past few years, I've been keeping my notes and books organized in Scrivener. The *Player's Guide*, *Explorer's Guide*, and *Biographer's Guide* were all written and divided up in various parts within scrivener. It's served me well overall, but exporting to a useful format has been painful.

For layout, I've been using Scribus, but it's also a pain in the butt- it doesn't really play well with the editing process- it's a very manual process to get your text in, formatted, and aligned. The combination of these two tools are awkward at best and infuriating at worst.

Unlike the previous two books, the *Biographer's Guide* has a ton of redundantly-formatted content. The thought of formatting 200 identically written NPC entries in Scribus makes me physically ill, so I wanted to find a better way.

My friend (and awesome editor) James has been trying to convince me to use LaTeX for formatting, and I think this is probably a good time to give it a try. In addition, he's suggested using Org-Mode in Spacemacs. As a long-time vim user, the thought of using emacs (even with vim bindings) is uncomfortable, but I'm going to give it a try.

I'll keep you posted on how it goes.
